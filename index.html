            <p class="card-text"> Hope for Children is a beacon of hope for vulnerable children within the United States and around the world. Their mission is bring awareness and action against child violence. Their website displayed awareness and training but little to no action items. Their recent goal was to find a way to engage the public in demanding congress declare child abuse a national emergency before leadership changes.  
                As a team, we asked ourselves, how might we create a user- friendly interface with a simplified donation and petition-signing process on the Hope for Children website?</p>

                <p>Goal 2- Restructure their main navigation menu to all for easier navigation throughout their website</p>
                <p>Goal 3- Add a petition for users to sign that would allow the nonprofit tangible numbers of support  to bring  to congress.</p>
                <p>Goal 4- Simplify their donation process to bring in more funds for the organization</p>
                <p>Goal 5- Consolidate their secondary pages for contacting the organization so that it is more user friendly to conenct with the organization and the organization does not miss out on important connections.</p>

We were also advised to ensure our design aligned with the style guide we created to set the design tone.

              <p class="conclusion">Through this project, we learned how to conduct user interviews with stakeholders and clients to understand their website goals better. We brainstormed ways to create a smoother, more enjoyable user experience and successfully redesigned the homepage, simplifying the donation and contact processes. Additionally, we added a petition feature to generate real-life responses and actionable data for Congress. If we had more time, we could have further streamlined secondary navigation pages, redesigned the job opportunity pages, and created a more interactive design to encourage users to donate, sign the petition, and engage in free training courses the organization provides to increase public awareness. We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to a local organization that is doing outstanding work.</p>
